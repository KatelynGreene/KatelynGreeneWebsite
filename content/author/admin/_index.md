Hi there :) I'm a 2nd year PhD student at Wake Forest University within the Center for Injury Biomechanics. My research interests are at the intersection of bio-inspired design, biomechanics, and computer science.

I also enjoy rollerblading, hiking, and pretty much anything else that involves being outside!
