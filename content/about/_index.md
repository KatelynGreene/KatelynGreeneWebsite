Hi there,

My story is full of diverse threads, inspiring people, and spontaneous adventures!  

Growing up, I moved around several times - from Germany, to South Carolina, to Oklahoma, to California. I have slowly made my way out west and enjoyed every moment of it. I'm perfectly happy to have friends everywhere and [no roots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUdyuKaGQd4) in any particular hometown. As a kid, I loved to be in the mud, building sandcastles at the beach, playing with lizards and ladybugs, building ropes courses in our backyard trees, and creating elaborate fantasy worlds with my playmobil and lego kits. I never settled on any one sport, and instead preferred to explore them all - gymnastics, tennis, soccer, swimming, basketball, rock climbing. In high school, my interest in engineering developed through my experience as a mechanical design engineer on our school's FIRST robotics team (1717, The D'Penguineers).

All of these diverse curiosities eventually evolved into a passion to understand overlap between engineering and biology. I completed my undergraduate degree in Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley. I had some fantastic graduate student mentors in integrative biology labs who allowed me to work alongside them in researching the biomechanics of fungal spore transmission and gecko gliding. From there, I decided to end my westward migration and return to the East Coast to pursue a PhD in Biomedical Engineering through the joint graduate program between Virginia Tech and Wake Forest University. Eventually, I'm seeking a career in healthcare informatics to improve the availability and accessibility of medical data to empower people to make informed daily decisions about their health. 

When I'm not in lab, I love to endurance rollerblade, bike, rock climb, hike and garden! I'm also always on the lookout for brunch places with excellent french toast. :)

A few of my favorite things...

* fresh squeezed apple juice
* raisins and goldfish
* lying in a field of tall grass when it's breezy
* swinging way too high on swings
* cool rain on summer nights

Some things I'm learning right now:

* Data visualization techniques
* Capturing pictures with natural lighting on a DSLR
* Scientific communication techniques
* Version control with git
