Hi there,

My story is full of diverse threads, inspiring people, and spontaneous adventures!  

Growing up, I moved around several times. From South Carolina, to Oklahoma, to California - I have slowly made my way out West and enjoyed every moment of it. I loved to be in the mud, building sandcastles at the beach, playing with lizards and ladybugs, building ropes courses in our backyard trees, and creating elaborate fantasy worlds with playmobil and lego kits. I'm incredibly grateful for the exposure to different cultures across America, for the opportunities that have led to friendships that stretch across state lines and vast oceans, and I'm content to have [no roots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUdyuKaGQd4) in any particular hometown. 

All of my diverse interests and experiences eventually evolved into a passion to understand overlap between engineering and biology. I completed my undergraduate degree in Bioengineering at the University of California, Berkeley. Along the way, I took numerous courses in computer science, which allowed me to develop a valuable foundation in data structures, algorithms, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, and statistical computing. The combination of advanced biological courses and computer science projects has given me a unique perspective in how I approach engineering problems in medicine and biology. 

In addition to my undergraduate classes, I had several fantastic mentors in integrative biology laboratories who allowed me to work alongside them in researching the biomechanics of fungal spore transmission and gecko gliding. From there, I decided to end my westward migration and return to the East Coast to pursue a PhD in Biomedical Engineering through the joint graduate program between Virginia Tech and Wake Forest University. I currently use biomedical image analysis and finite element modeling to study how long-duration microgravity exposure affects the human musculoskeletal system and influences injury risk among astronauts! 

After completing my graduate education, I'm interested in pursuing a career involving healthcare informatics. I aspire to improve the availability and accessibility of medical data to empower people to make informed daily decisions about their health. 

When I'm not working, I love to endurance rollerblade, bike, rock climb, hike, and garden! Also, I'm always on the lookout for brunch places with excellent french toast. :)

A few of my favorite things...

* fresh squeezed apple juice
* cool rain on summer nights
* homemade trail mix that includes raisins and goldfish
* lying in a field of tall grasses when it's breezy

What I'm learning right now:

* Data visualization techniques
* Capturing pictures with natural lighting on a DSLR
* Scientific communication techniques
* Version control with git
